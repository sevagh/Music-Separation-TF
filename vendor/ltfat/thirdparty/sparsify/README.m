% 1) Copy the folder sparsify wherever you like. 
% 2) Include the folder sparsify and all sub-folders in the Matlab search path.
%
% __________________OVERVIEW__________________
%
% sparsify is a set of Matlab m files implementing a range of different algorithms 
% to calculate sparse signal approximations. See ALGORITHMS below for a list of 
% available algorithms.
%
% __________________COMPATIBILITY__________________
%
% sparsify was tested with Matlab 7.2 and 7.4.
% sparsify does not require any additional toolboxes.
%
% All functions are designed to work with different input formats.
% The specific formatting instructions can be found in function_format.m and
% object_format.m
%
% The function format is compatible to the l1-magic toolbox [1] and with the GPSR software [4].
% The object format is compatible with the l1_ls.m algorithm [3].
% Unfortunately, SparseLab [5] uses a different function format, however, this 
% can easily be converted into the format required for sparsify using: 
% D  =@(z) P(1, m, n, z, I, dim)
% and
% Dt =@(z) P(2, m, n, z, I, dim)
% where P is the function used in SparseLab. D and Dt are then the functions
% required for sparsify. See function_format.m for more information.

%
% greed_omp.m	Orthogonal matching Pursuit algorithm. Different implementations are 
%		accessible through greed_omp.m. These are also available directly:
%   greed_omp_qr.m 		OMP using QR factorisation (Fastest algorithm but 
%				requires most storage.)
% 	greed_omp_chol.m	OMP using Cholesky factorisation (Slower than QR 
% 				based method but less storage required. Useful up 
%				to around 10 000 non-zero coefficients)
% 	greed_omp_cg.m 		OMP using full conjugate gradient solver in each
%				iteration (Only option if everything else fails. But 
%				can be slow.)
% 	greed_omp_cgp.m		OMP using Conjugate Gradient Pursuit algorithm [1] 
%				(Similar to QR based method)
% 	greed_omp_pinv.m	OMP using pinv command (NOT RECOMMENDED, for 
%				reference only.)	
% 	greed_omp_linsolve.m	OMP using linsolve command (NOT RECOMMENDED, for 
%				reference only.)

% greed_ols.m	Orthogonal Least Squares Algorithm (similar to OMP but with a 
% 		different element selection rule) see [6]. (Requires storage of Dictionary as matrix, so only applicable for small problems.)

% greed_mp.m	Matching Pursuit algorithm

% greed_gp.m 	Greedy Pursuit algorithm from [1] (Can be used if OMP is too costly.)

% greed_nomp.m  Approximate Conjugate Gradient Pursuit (ACGP) from [1] (Can be used 
%		if OMP is too costly. Slower but better than GP in general.)

% greed_nomppgc.m 	Nearly Orthogonal Matching Pursuit with partial Conjugate 
% 		Gradients (NOMPpCG) a mixture between Gradient Pursuit and 
% 		Approximate Conjugate Gradient Pursuit using a gradient step
% 		when a new element is selected and an ACGP step when no new 
% 		element is selected. This guarantees convergence in a finite
% 		number of steps but can give worse results in practice than ACGP. 
% 
% nonlin_gg Gradient based greedy algorithm to solve non-linear sparse problems [8].
%
% hard_l0_reg	Iterative hard thresholding algorithm keeping elements larger than fixed 
%		threshold in each iteration [7].
% hard_lo_Mterm Iterative hard thresholding algorithm keeping largest M elements
%		in each iteration [7, 9, 10]. This algorithm now includes an
%		automatic stepsize calculation as derived in [10]

% All algorithm names are preceded by the identifiers greed_ or hard_ (see above)
% This ensures that conflicts with other toolboxes implementing the same algorithm

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Input
%   Mandatory:
%               x   Observation vector to be decomposed
%               P   Either:
%                       1) An nxm matrix (n must be dimension of x)
%                       2) A function handle (type "help function_format" 
%                          for more information)
%                          Also requires specification of P_trans option.
%                       3) An object handle (type "help object_format" for 
%                          more information)
%               m   length of s 
%
%   Possible additional options:
%   (specify as many as you want using 'option_name','option_value' pairs)
%   See below for explanation of options:

%
%   Available stopping criteria :
%               M           -   Extracts exactly M = stopTol elements.
%               corr        -   Stops when maximum correlation between
%                               residual and atoms is below stopTol value.
%               mse         -   Stops when mean squared error of residual 
%                               is below stopTol value.
%               mse_change  -   Stops when the change in the mean squared 
%                               error falls below stopTol value.
%
%   stopTol: Value for stopping criterion.
%
%   P_trans: If P is a function handle, then P_trans has to be specified and 
%            must be a function handle. 
%
%   maxIter: Maximum number of allowed iterations.
%
%   verbose: Logical value to allow algorithm progress to be displayed.
%
%   start_val: Allows algorithms to start from partial solution.
%
%   GradSteps: Number of gradient optimisation steps per iteration.
%              'auto' uses inner products to decide if more gradient steps 
%              are required. 
%
%   wf: weakness factor alpha (see [2] and [3]). Algorithm will select all 
%       elements fror which P_TRANS RESIDUAL >= alpha max(|P_trans residual|)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Outputs
%    s              Solution vector 
%    err_mse        Vector containing mse of approximation error for each 
%                   iteration
%    iter_time      Vector containing computation times for each iteration
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Description
%   greed_nomp performs a greedy signal decomposition. 
%   In each iteration a new element is selected depending on the inner
%   product between the current residual and columns in P.
%   A directional update is used that is conjuagte to the previously used
%   direction.
%   
%   THIS ALGORITHM IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO OMP IF OMP IS NOT FEASIBLE DUE TO
%   COMPUTATION TIME OR STORAGE REQUIREMENTS! IT IS IN GENERAL BETTER THAN
%   greed_gp

%
% Change history
% 9th of May: Set update direction to gradient for first iteration. 
%             Otherwise incorrect direction is used when initial vector is given. 
%
% 22 of November: Original code did not calculate b value correctly. This
%                 has now been fixed.
%
% 14 of December: Faster implementation using recursive calculation of Dp
%
%  4 of January: Implemented weak element selection. This allows the
%  algorithm to select more than a single element in each iteration.
%
% 8 of Februray: Algo does no longer stop if dictionary is not normaliesd.
%
% 29 of Februray: USed unon command to combine selected elements.

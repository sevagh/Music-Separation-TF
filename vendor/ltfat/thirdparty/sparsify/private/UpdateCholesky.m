% UpdateCholesky: Updates a cholesky decomposition matrix R'R=A 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Usage
% R = UpdateCholesky(R,P,Pt,index);
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Input
%   Mandantory:
%               R       upper triangular matrix, such that R'*R =
%                       PT(index(1:end-1))*P((1:end-1))
%               P       is a function handle (type "help function_format" 
%                       for more information)
%               Pt      is a function handle
%               index is the set of all non-zero indices, must be 1 larger
%                       than dimension of R.
%               m       dimension of space from which P maps
%
% Outputs :     R is traingular matrix such that R'*R = PT(index)*P(index)

% greed_ols: Orthogonal Least Squares algorithm
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Usage
%   [s, err_mse, iter_time]=greed_ols(x,P,m,'option_name','option_value');
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Input
%   Mandatory:
%               x   Observation vector to be decomposed
%               P   Either:
%                       1) An nxm matrix (n must be dimension of x)
%                       2) A function handle (type "help function_format" 
%                          for more information)
%                          Also requires specification of P_trans option.
%                       3) An object handle (type "help object_format" for 
%                          more information)
%                       NOTE: The algorithm works on matrices, so P will be
%                       converted to matrix. This means that the algorithm
%                       only works for small problems.
%               m   length of s 
%
%   Possible additional options:
%   (specify as many as you want using 'option_name','option_value' pairs)
%   See below for explanation of options:

%   start_val       VECTOR OF LENGTH M                          zeros
%
%   Available stopping criteria :
%               M           -   Extracts exactly M = stopTol elements.
%               corr        -   Stops when maximum correlation between
%                               residual and atoms is below stopTol value.
%               mse         -   Stops when mean squared error of residual 
%                               is below stopTol value.
%               mse_change  -   Stops when the change in the mean squared 
%                               error falls below stopTol value.
%
%   stopTol: Value for stopping criterion.
%
%   P_trans: If P is a function handle, then P_trans has to be specified and 
%            must be a function handle. 
%
%   maxIter: Maximum of allowed iterations.
%
%   verbose: Logical value to allow algorithm progress to be displayed.
%
%   start_val: Allows algorithms to start from partial solution.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Outputs
%    s              Solution vector 
%    err_mse        Vector containing mse of approximation error for each 
%                   iteration
%    iter_time      Vector containing times for each iteration
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Description
%   greed_ols performs a greedy signal decomposition. 
%   In each iteration a new element is selected that will reduce the 
%   residual error the most in the next step. This is different from OMP.
%   See [1] and [2] for details.
%   The non-zero elements of s are approximated by orthogonally projecting 
%   x onto the selected elements in each iteration.
%   The algorithm uses QR factorisation.

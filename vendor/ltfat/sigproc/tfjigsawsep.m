%TFJIGSAWSEP Time frequency jigsaw puzzle tonal-transient separation
%   Usage:  fplanes = tfjigsawsep(f);
%           fplanes = tfjigsawsep(f,r1,r2);
%           fplanes = tfjigsawsep(f,r1,r2,p);
%           [fplanes, cplanes, info] = tfjigsawsep(...);
%
%   Input parameters:
%            f        : Input signal
%            r1       : Significance level of the tonal layer refered to
%                       a white noise reference
%            r2       : Same for the transient layer
%            p        : Proportionfactor of the supertilesizes relative 
%                       to the time-, and frequency stepsize 
%    
%   Output parameters:
%           fplanes   : signallength-by-3 array containing the 3 produced
%                       layers, tonal in fplanes(:,1), transient in
%                       fplanes(:,2) and the noisy residual in fplanes(:,3).
%           cplanes   : 3-by-1 cellarray containing the Gabor coefficients
%                       for the individual layers
%
%   TFJIGSAWSEP(f) applies the separation algorithm on the input signal f*
%   and returns the tonal, the transient and the residual parts.
%   The following default values are used, r1=r2=0.95, p=4 and for the 
%   3 Gabor systems:
%   
%       "Tonal" system:     g1 = {'hann',4096}; a1 = 512; M1 = 4096;
%   
%       "Transient" system: g2 = {'hann',256};  a2 = 32;  M2 = 256;
%
%       "Residual" system:  g3 = {'hann',2048}; a3 = 512; M3 = 2048;
%   
%   TFJIGSAWSEP(f,r1,r2) works as before, but allows changing threshold
%   parameters r1 and r2. Good values are in range [0.85,0.95]. 
%   t2 sometimes has to be chosen larger (~ 1.05), eg. for 
%   percussions in music signals.
%
%   TFJIGSAWSEP(f,r1,r2,p) (recommended) additionally allows changing the
%   size of the supertiles to a1*p in timesamples and b2*p in
%   frequencysamples. The choice of this particular proportion is
%   reasonable since it provides equal numbers of coefficients of the two
%   Gabor systems in each supertile. Good values are in the range of [1,10],
%   but it depends very much on the type of signal.
%   E.g. for speech signals, higher values yield better results.   
%
%   [fplanes, cplanes, info] = TFJIGSAWSEP(...) additionally returns
%   a 3 element cell array cplanes containing DGTREAL coefficients
%   of the respective separated layers and a structure info, with the
%   parameters used in the algorithm. The relationship between fplanes*
%   and cplanes is the following:

%   Additional parameters:
%   ----------------------
%
%   The function accepts the following flags:
%
%       'ver2' Uses the second version of the algorithm.
%
%       'plot' Plots the separated waveforms and the coefficients.
%
%       'verbose' Information about the boundary condition.
%
%
%   and the following key-value pairs:
%      
%       'wintype' Requested windowtype
%
%       'winsize1' and 'winsize2' Windowlengths
%
%       'a1' and 'a2' Time stepsizes
%
%       'M1' and 'M2' Number of frequency channels
%
%       'T' and 'F' Supertile sizes in samples manually - alternative to p!
%
%       'maxit' Maximum number of iterations. The default value is 15.
%
%   Algorithm:
%   ----------
%
%   The algorithm is based on [1]. It transforms a signal into a two-windowed
%   Gabor expansion such that one wide window shall lead to a high frequency
%   resolution (tonal layer is represented well) and a narrow one to a high
%   time resolution (transient layer is repr. well). The resulting Gabor
%   coefficients are respectively considered within rectangular 'supertiles'
%   in the time-frequency plane. An entropy criterion chooses those tiles
%   respectively, where tonal and transient parts of the signal are
%   represented better and are below a estimated threshold. The rest is set
%   to zero. The leftover Gabor coefficients are transformed back and
%   subtracted from the original signal. By applying this procedure
%   iteratively on the residual, tonal and transient layers emerge.
%
%   Examples:
%   ---------
%   
%   The following example shows the basic usage of the function:::
%     
%     % Load the glockenspiel test signal and add some noise
%     [f,fs] = gspi; f = f + 0.001*randn(size(f));
%     % Setup the parameters
%     p = 2; r1 = 0.92; r2 = 0.93;
%     [fplanes,cplanes,info] = tfjigsawsep(f,r1,r2,p,'plot','ver2','fs',fs);

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Remarks %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%   The residual condition is computed very heuristically, designing it   %
%   more flexible would be a nice improvement of the algorithm.           %
%   It would also be useful to provide parameter settings for specific    %
%   types of signals (ie. speech, music,...) .                            %
%                                                                         %
%   Version 1 of the algorithm (default) works particularly well for      %
%   speech signals, but also for depicting the transient layer            %
%   (eg. percussive elements) nicely in musical signals.                  %
%   Version 2 works particularly well for depicting a nice tonal layer.   %

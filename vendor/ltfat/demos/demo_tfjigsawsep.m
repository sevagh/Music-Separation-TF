%DEMO_TFJIGSAWSEP - Decomposition of an audio signal into tonal, transient and residual layers
%
%   This demo shows how to use tfjigsawsep, where a signal is decomposed
%   into its tonal, transient and noisy residual layers. 
%   
%   The algorithm is based on [1]. It transforms a signal into a two-windowed
%   Gabor expansion such that one wide window shall lead to a high frequency
%   resolution (tonal layer is represented well) and a narrow one to a high
%   time resolution (transient layer is repr. well). The resulting Gabor
%   coefficients in the time-frequency plane are grided adaptively into rectangular
%   'supertiles', whithin one by one an entropy criterion decides, which
%   layer of the signal (tonal, transient) is represented better. This tile
%   will be kept if it is below a certain threshold, the other one is thrown
%   away. After running through the whole tf-plane, the respectively
%   leftover Gabor coefficients are transformed back and substracted 
%   from the original signal. By applying this procedure iteratively,
%   tonal and transient layers emerge.
%   A second version of the algorithm is available. Here the entropy
%   criterion chooses those tiles, where the tonal part of the signal is
%   represented better and is below a given threshold. The rest is set to
%   zero. The leftover Gabor coefficients are transformed back and
%   substracted from the original signal. Then the same is applied again to
%   choose those tiles, where the transient part is represented better.
%   After that, one gets the first approximation of the two layers. By
%   applying this procedure iteratively on the residual, tonal and
%   transient layers emerge.

%   tfjigsawsep takes three very crucial parameters, t1,t2 and p. One has to
%   tweak and play with them to obtain good results:
%
%   t1 and t2 determine 'how likely' a part of the signal has been produced
%   by white noise. Good values are within (0.85,0.98), usually t2 > t1 works
%   well.
%
%   For speech signals lower values for t1 care for better noiseextraction
%   for musical signals, sometimes even t2 > 1 is necessary to extract all
%   the percussion elements
%
%   p determines the size of the supertiles and can be chosen within
%   (0,min(L/a1,M2/2)]. Values below 10 work best (tendencies):
%   higher for speech signals,lower for musical signals
%
%   Version 1 works particularly well for speech signals and detecting
%   percussive elements in musical signals, version 2 depicts the tonal layer
%   very nice, but is slower.
%
%   The default parameters are r1=r2=0.95, p=4 and the default settings for
%   the 3 Gabor systems are:
%   
%       "Tonal" system:     g1 = {'hann',4096}; a1 = 512; M1 = 4096;
%   
%       "Transient" system: g2 = {'hann',256};  a2 = 32;  M2 = 256;
%
%       "Residual" system:  g3 = {'hann',2048}; a3 = 512; M3 = 2048;

% Several scenarios are provided to give a demonstration, what effects the
% choice of the parameters have. Declare the corresp. string below.
%
% glockenspiel signal with added noise - version 2 of the algorithm:
%    'glo1': suitable parameters
%    'glo2': supertile size too large, tonal parts are in the transient layer
%    'glo3': t1 too large, t2 too small - transient parts are in the tonal
%            layer
%
% speech signal with added noise, a person says 'the cocktailpartyeffect' -
% version 1:
%    'spe1': suitable parameters
%    'spe2': supertile size too small, the algorithm cannot detect the
%            transients that are essential for speech signals properly
%    'spe3': t2 too large, tonal parts are in the transient layer
%
% synthetic test signal with dirac-like impulses and added noise -
% version 2:
%    'syn': the algorithm struggles with seperating high frequency impulses
%           and noise

This Software implements the haircell model and the adaptation loops described
in [Dau et al., JASA 1996] as C functions, to be incorporated into MATLAB as
a MEX function.

Furthermore it implements the adaptation loops described in [Dau et al., JASA 1997],
which differ from that described in [Dau et al., JASA 1996] by limiting the output
of each loop as proposed by [Muenkner, 1993].

Note that the Matlab-code for the complex-valued Gammatone-filterbank (according
to Hohmann, 2002) is also available for academic purposes from
http://www.physik.uni-oldenburg.de/docs/medi.

Files:
Haircell model:
haircell.c
haircell.dll
Adaptation loops:
adapt.h
adapt.c (1996 version)
adapt.dll
adapt_m.c (1997 version)
adapt_m.dll

All DLL's are compiled for Matlab R11.1 under Windows.

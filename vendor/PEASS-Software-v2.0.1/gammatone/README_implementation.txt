This directory contains a Matlab implementation of the gammatone
filterbank described in V. Hohmann's Paper `Frequency analysis and
synthesis using a Gammatone filterbank', published 2002 in `acta
acustica'.  It uses numerical methods described in `Improved numerical
methods for gammatone filterbank analysis and synthesis' by T. Herzke
and V. Hohmann, published 2007 in `acta acustica'.

Design principles
=================

An object oriented design is used in this implementation.  Global variables
are mostly avoided, except for global constants that do not change during exe-
cution.

Although object oriented, this implementation does not use Matlab's
native classes and objects.  Instead, objects are implemented as
Matlab structures, and have, among other fields, a field called `type'
that identifies the name of the class of this object.  Methods that
act on this object are normal Matlab functions.  Their names start
with the name of the class, followed by an underscore.  All methods
(except for the constructors, named `<class name>_new') expect, as
their first argument, the object on which they should act.  Because
Matlab lacks a call-by-reference, all methods return, as their last
return argument, a (possibly changed) copy of this object.

All class names and function names of this implementation have a prefix `Gfb_'
(for Gammatone FilterBank), and the names of all global constants have a prefix
`GFB_'.

Implementation details
======================

A list of classes and their methods follows.  For a detailed description of the
methods, please refer to their online help within matlab.  Referenced Equations
are contained in the 2002 `acta acustica' article.

                                       The filter coefficient is either speci-
                                       fied directly;  or it can be derived
                                       from sampling frequency, center fre-
                                       quency, and filter order `gamma' with
                                       equations (10),(13),(14);  or it can be
                                       derived from sampling frequency, center
                                       frequency, bandwidth, attenuation, and
                                       filter order `gamma' with equations
                                       (10),(11),(12)

                                       equations (13),(14).  Sampling rate,
                                       lower cutoff frequency, base frequency,
                                       upper cutoff frequency, and density of
                                       the filters on the ERBscale have to be
                                       specified

This directory contains a Matlab implementation of the gammatone
filterbank described in V. Hohmann's Paper `Frequency analysis and
synthesis using a Gammatone filterbank', published 2002 in `acta
acustica'.  It uses numerical methods described in `Improved numerical
methods for gammatone filterbank analysis and synthesis' by T. Herzke
and V. Hohmann, published 2007 in `acta acustica'.

Documentation
=============

README_implementation.txt:  Introduces the design principles behind this
                            implementation, and containes a list of the 
                            implemented Matlab functions.
README_examples.txt:        Explains where to find the specific implementations
			    and how to execute the examples promised in section
                            5 of Hohmann's 2002 `acta acustica' article.
